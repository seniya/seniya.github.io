저는 주로 Javascript 기술을 사용하여 작업하는 웹 중심 개발자입니다. 현재 서울 소재 회사에 다니는 직장인입니다. 이것은 제 개인 웹사이트 및 블로그로 여러가지 생각과 기술을 정리하기 위하여 노트를 개시합니다.

## About this Site

This is a static site powered by Jekyll. The design was done by me and the theme is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro). I have used Bootstrap, jQuery, icons from Metro Studio of Syncfusion and Github for hosting the site.

Technicals apart, this is my personal site where I plan to pen down my thoughts, technical experiences that I would like to share. But, the content and opnion that you see here are personal and not related to companies / clients i work with. And regarding the code you see there.. you may use it as per your discretion.

## About this Theme

Jekyll Metro is the result of wanting a clean and new theme for my personal site. I was initially inspired by the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde). but soon I was googling to see if there are any Metro inspired theme available.
Since, I couldn't find one, I decided to built one for myself. One of the main goal of building my own theme was to have a modern responsive theme that looks good on mobile, tablet and desktop.

You are free to use or fork this theme. And any contribution to fixes of issues are welcome.
